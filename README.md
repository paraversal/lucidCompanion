# What is lucidCompanion?
lucidCompanion is a highly customisable cross-platform journalling application specifically designed to accommodate the needs of (aspiring) lucid dreamers. 

# What is special about lucidCompanion?
Our highest priority for lucidCompanion is customisability and flexibility. This of course includes an open source, but it also includes a highly customisable journalling interface and a database format that can be easily read by other applications for integration into workflows or data preparation.
